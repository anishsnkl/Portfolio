## Anish Sankla Engineering Portfolio

Hello! My name is Anish Sankla and I am an Aerospace Engineering student at The University of Maryland, College Park. This portfolio is designed to supplement my resume by demonstrating my practical experience in engineering. I have had the opportunity to participate in many projects, both in and out of the classroom, which has enabled me to improve my critical thinking skills and add new skills to my toolbelt. It is my hope that this will allow you to better assess how my skills can be applied to your company. Thank you for looking at what I have created.

You can access the portfolio under the file labelled "Anish Sankla Design Portfolio"
